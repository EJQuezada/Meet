# Meet App

Meet App helps user find, book, and confirm attendance to events in the user's city or in a location of their choice. User will be able to: 
1) filter Events by City,
2) show/hide the details of an event,
3) specify the number of events to be displayed,
4) use the Meet application even when offline, and
5) visualize in a chart all upcoming events in each city so that user can use it to determine events of interest.

## Use of Serverless:
The app will utilize tokens for authorization that will be generated in an authorization server. Using this token, users will then be able to access event data from the Google Calendar API.
