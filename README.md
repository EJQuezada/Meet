# Meet App

Meet App helps user find, book, and confirm attendance to events in the user's city or in a location of their choice. User will be able to 1) filter Events by City, 2) show/hide the details of an event, 3) specify the number of events to be displayed, 4) use the Meet application even when offline, and 5) visualize in a chart all upcoming events in each city so that user can use it to determine events of interest.
